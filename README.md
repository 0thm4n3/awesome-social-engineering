Social Engineering Books
=================

#### Social Engineering: The Art of Human Hacking
The first book to reveal and dissect the technical aspect of many social engineering maneuvers
From elicitation, pretexting, influence and manipulation all aspects of social engineering are picked apart, discussed and explained by using real world examples, personal experience and the science behind them to unraveled the mystery in social engineering.

[Social Engineering: The Art of Human Hacking - Chris Hadnagy](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Social-Engineering-Art-Human-Hacking/dp/0470639539/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1494622911&sr=8-1&keywords=chris+hadnagy)


#### No tech Hacking
As professional hackers, Johnny Long and Kevin Mitnick get paid to uncover weaknesses in those systems and exploit them. Whether breaking into buildings or slipping past industrial-grade firewalls, their goal has always been the same: extract the information using any means necessary. After hundreds of jobs, they have discovered the secrets to bypassing every conceivable high-tech security system. This book reveals those secrets; as the title suggests, it has nothing to do with high technology.

[No Tech Hacking - Johnny Long, Kevin D. Mitnick](https://www.amazon.co.uk/No-Tech-Hacking-Engineering-Dumpster/dp/1597492159/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1494624109&sr=8-1&keywords=no+tech+hacking)

##### The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security
Mitnick explains why all the firewalls and encryption protocols in the world will never be enough to stop a savvy grifter intent on rifling a corporate database or an irate employee determined to crash a system.  Mitnick offers advice for preventing these types of social engineering hacks through security protocols, training programs, and manuals that address the human element of security.
